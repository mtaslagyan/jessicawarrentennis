                <p class="testimonial-highlight">"Jessica is an outstanding tennis coach!</p>

                <p>I cannot thank her enough for how brilliantly she has trained my youngest son. He developed an interest in tennis several years ago, the first time he had been interested in any athletic activity, despite exposing and encouraging him to quite a few. When I asked a good friend whose children had been playing seriously for 10 years for a recommendation, without hesitation he suggested Jessica.</p> 
        
                <p>Right from the first lesson I could see how serious and experienced she was. She was sharply focused and from the wide range of smart drills and activities she had him doing, it was clear she knew a great deal about tennis and fitness. The lesson variety also helped to keep my son’s short attention span interested. </p>
         
                <p>Jessica is also really great with kids. She’s sensitive to my son’s mood and condition and temperament and has an easy laugh and keeps it really fun, which is especially important for my son who resists a firm hand. He has been enjoying his lessons so much, going from a complete beginner to a decent intermediate and even joining the school tennis team in short order!</p>
        
                <p>When the quarantine began, I expressed to her my concern about my son dropping off with his conditioning, and she immediately set up a program to train him via facetime which has helped to keep him in good shape. I am really grateful for Jessica’s efforts. She clearly cares a lot about tennis and my son and is tireless and passionate about doing an excellent job and is just a fantastic person."</p>

                <div class="testimonial-content">"Jessica is an amazing tennis coach. I was able to receive her masterful instruction this summer in the Hamptons. She intuitively knew how to help me with my forehand swing. I have taken many lessons with other pros; unfortunately, no one was able to get me to the next level. She thoughtfully instructed me through specific drills that targeted my shortfalls. I highly recommend her skillful training."</div>

I’ve taught tennis for more than 30 years including teaching tennis in the Physical Education Department at USC. I regularly send clients to Jessica when I don’t have time for them."</div>
