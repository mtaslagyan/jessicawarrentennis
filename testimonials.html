                <p>"When I first met Jessica at Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Florida, I was instantly drawn to her energy and passion for tennis. starting our practices at 7am, she was always the first one on court and always had an upbeat energy about her. Growing up, I was always drawn towards encouraging and positive coaches, and Jessica embodies both of these qualities and more. When drilling, she always wants to hit one more shot or play one more point, which is something I always do as well. There aren't many players that are willing to go out on their own and drill for hours, but, like me, Jessica is always up for working hard. 
Recently, I played a $30,000 Women's Prize Money tournament, where I defeated a girl top 130 ITF and another who is ranked #24 ITF. Having Jessica watch me from the bench gave me a sense of relief as well as confidence, because she always believed in me. She always tells me what a "beast" I am and how she loves my game. With this in mind, I was able to stay calm in my matches and pull out big wins. Her love for tennis as well as her drive are just a few things that I really admire about Jessica. Although she is not my "coach", she has always given me confidence about my game and pushes me to work my best every time we are on court."</p>

                <p>"Thank you so much Jessica for inspiring me to workout and get in shape, especially in quarantine. It's really been a big help with my physical and mental health. It's been a big motivation to also have a great coach who encourages me to do things I don't want to. I have been having so much fun working out with you and seeing what you have been doing in Florida. I look forward to hear about all your fun and cool stories."</p>

<!--                 <p class="testimonial-highlight">"We think very highly of Jessica!</p> -->
                <p>We would not hesitate to give her a strong recommendation for anyone who is looking for a fun, dedicated, hard working and very kind tennis coach, this list goes on...We met her at Evert tennis camp, and could not be happier when we got her to be our daughter's coach, one hour a day was enough for Jessica to boost her confidence and fix little things that needed to be fixed in such a fun and loving way. We wish Jessica all the best and truly hope to cross paths with her again."</p>

                <!-- <p class="testimonial-highlight">"Jessica is an outstanding tennis coach!</p> -->

                <p>I cannot thank her enough for how brilliantly she has trained my youngest son. He developed an interest in tennis several years ago, the first time he had been interested in any athletic activity, despite exposing and encouraging him to quite a few. When I asked a good friend whose children had been playing seriously for 10 years for a recommendation, without hesitation he suggested Jessica.</p> 
        
                <p>Right from the first lesson I could see how serious and experienced she was. She was sharply focused and from the wide range of smart drills and activities she had him doing, it was clear she knew a great deal about tennis and fitness. The lesson variety also helped to keep my son’s short attention span interested. </p>
         
                <p>Jessica is also really great with kids. She’s sensitive to my son’s mood and condition and temperament and has an easy laugh and keeps it really fun, which is especially important for my son who resists a firm hand. He has been enjoying his lessons so much, going from a complete beginner to a decent intermediate and even joining the school tennis team in short order!</p>
        
                <p>When the quarantine began, I expressed to her my concern about my son dropping off with his conditioning, and she immediately set up a program to train him via facetime which has helped to keep him in good shape. I am really grateful for Jessica’s efforts. She clearly cares a lot about tennis and my son and is tireless and passionate about doing an excellent job and is just a fantastic person."</p>

                <div class="testimonial-content">"Jessica is an amazing tennis coach. I was able to receive her masterful instruction this summer in the Hamptons. She intuitively knew how to help me with my forehand swing. I have taken many lessons with other pros; unfortunately, no one was able to get me to the next level. She thoughtfully instructed me through specific drills that targeted my shortfalls. I highly recommend her skillful training."</div>

She uses many different activities during her lessons to keep her students motivated and her knowledge of tennis immense. I’ve taught tennis for more than 30 years including teaching tennis in the Physical Education Department at USC. I regularly send clients to Jessica when I don’t have time for them."</div>
